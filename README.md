# Mini-Hackathon Project at Boston University College of Fine Arts and Spark!

## Overview
This repository contains the project we developed during a mini-hackathon hosted by Boston University College of Fine Arts and Spark! We were a team of 6 dedicated individuals who collaborated to bring this project to life. The project showcase is how language and representation matters on a global scale.

## Technologies Used
We utilized a diverse set of technologies to build this project:
- **p5.js**: A JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of Processing, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this for today's web.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the web pages.
- **Python**: A versatile language, used in this project for backend development.
- **Figma**: A cloud-based design tool, used for UI/UX design.
- **R**: A language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

## Team
This project was a collaborative effort by a team of 6 members: 2 graduate Graphic Design Majors, 1 Master in Stats, 2 Data Science Majors, and 1 Comp Sci Major. Each member brought unique skills and perspectives to the table, contributing to the successful completion of the project.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to express our gratitude to Boston University College of Fine Arts and Spark! for hosting the mini-hackathon. The event provided us with a great platform to learn, innovate, and collaborate.
